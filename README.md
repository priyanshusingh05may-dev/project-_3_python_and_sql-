Navigating the Future of Online Shopping: E-commerce Data Analysis
Welcome to my project! This repository contains a deep dive into e-commerce data, where I’ve used SQL for data extraction and Python for advanced analytics and visualization. The goal was simple: to transform raw transaction data into meaningful business strategies.

 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a large-scale e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior, sales trends, and operational efficiency. It’s not just about running queries; it’s about answering real-world questions like:

Which regions are driving our sales?

Are customers actually coming back? (Retention Analysis)

How do payment methods (like installments) affect order volume?

 Tech Stack & Tools Used
Database: MySQL (Complex Joins, CTEs, and Window Functions)

Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn 
Presentation: Microsoft PowerPoint 

 Key Insights from the Analysis
1. Sales Performance
Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: Calculated the revenue trends to see how the business scaled.

Top Categories: Identified which the product categories contribute to the bulk of the revenue (Pareto Principle).

2. Customer Behavior
Geographic Distribution: Found that a few specific cities account for the majority of the orders, suggesting targeted marketing opportunities.

Retention Rate: Performed a 6-month retention analysis to determine how many customers made a repeat purchase.

3. Financial Metrics
Payment Trends: A significant 49.42% of orders were paid via installments, showing that flexible payment options are crucial for this market.

Revenue Concentration: Ranked sellers by their total revenue contribution to identify top-performing partners.
