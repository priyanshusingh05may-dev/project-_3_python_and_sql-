E-Commerce Data Analysis: A Comparative SQL & Python Approach
​ Project Overview
​This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract fundamental and strategic business insights. The analysis is performed twice—once using SQL (for database management and querying) and once using Python (for data manipulation and visualization)—to provide a comparative perspective on data handling.
​Repository Structure
​project 3 sql queries.sql: Contains the full SQL workflow, including database creation, table schema definitions, and analytical queries.
​project_3_python.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the Python implementation using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
​Navigating the Future of Online Shopping.pptx: A summary presentation deck visualizing the problem statements and key findings.
​ Tech Stack
​SQL: MySQL (Database Creation, Joins, Window Functions).
​Python: Pandas, NumPy (Data Cleaning & Analysis).
​Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
​🔍 Key Analysis & Problem Statements
​The project is divided into three levels of complexity:
​1. Basic Problems
​Identify unique cities where customers are located.
​Count the total number of orders placed in 2017.
​Calculate the percentage of orders paid in installments.  
​2. Intermediate Problems
​Group the average number of products per order by customer city.
​Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.  
​Analyze the correlation between product price and purchase frequency.  
​Rank sellers based on total revenue generated.  
​3. Advanced Problems
​Moving Average: Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their history.  
​Cumulative Sales: Track monthly cumulative sales for each year.  
​Retention Rate: Determine the customer repurchase rate within a 6-month window.
​Top Performers: Identify the top 3 customers by spending for each year 
Sample Visualization
​The Python analysis includes visualizations such as:
​Total orders per month in 2018.
​Revenue contribution by category.
